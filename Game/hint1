Try poking around what's in a file by using the 'head' command:

  head -n 20 people

This will show you the first 20 lines of the 'people' file.


## Additional hint
To a read a specific line in a file or a range of lines in file you can use:
- `sed`
- `awk`
- `head`
- `tail`
- and the pipe sybol `|`
  - Extra details: The pipe symbol represented as `|` is used to "pipe" the output from one command as the input of another command.  
  ex: `head -n 20 people | tail -n 5`  
  This command will read the first 20 lines of the `people` file and then use `tail` to finally display the last 5 lines froathat set of 20 lines

Example with sed:
This command will print line 233 of `<filename>`. The `-n` says to suppress deault output. The `233p` says to print the line.
`sed -n '223p' <filename>`

Example with awk:
awk is often used for filtering/formating output from commands but in this case it can be used to print line number 223.
the `'NR==223'` says tp print "record number (NR)" 223 which is equivalent of printing that line number.
`awk 'NR==223' <filename>`

You can also use grep to find a specific line in a file and then print a certain number of lines after the matched pattern.
Example with grep:
This example will look through `<filename>` for each found-matching-pattern of `somePattern`, then it will print that line and 5 lines after the match.
Take note that sometimes it does require some experimentation to get the right command to give you what you're looking for.
`grep -A 5 'somePattern' <filename>`

Additional example with grep:
This will do the same as before except further filter the output from the original command and "pipe" it into another grep command that will
look for `anotherPatternWithinThePreviousOutput` in the piped output and show the matched line as well as 2 lines after that match and 3 lines before the match.
`grep -A 5 "somePattern" <filename> | grep -A 2 -B 3 "anotherPatternWithinThePreviousOutput"`
``

**Common Grep command**
This will print out `<somefile>` and filter for the lines matching `somePatternYouAreLookingFor`.
`cat <somefile> | grep "somePatternYouAreLookingFor"`

Always remember that you can use `man grep` or `man awk` or `man sed`, etc. to get the manual pages for that command. You can also use google and other resources as well.
